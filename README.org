** Handy or fun functions for Emacs

   
*** pdf-avy-highlight.el
This is a function that uses avy to highlight by keyboard with pdf-tools. After
calling the function you type the initial pattern to set where to highlight
from, and subsequently type the number of it's label. Then repeat this to set
the end of the highlighted region. It works fine, but I concluded that using
the mouse is maybe sometimes not that bad :wink:.

In the demo below the first highlight is created using the mouse, while the
second is created using pdf-avy-highlight (both slowly, so you can follow what
happens)

*** ob-template.el
    Ah somewhat updated version of [[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/worg/raw/master/org-contrib/babel/ob-template.el][ob-template.el]] as found in section *Develop
    support for new languages* at the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/index.html][org babel website]].

    Some few small tips:
    - start with instrumenting [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Using-Edebug.html][see edebug]] the =org-babel-execute:template=
      function, and subsequently evaluate some test-code block. In this way you
      can easily figure out how org-babel processes header arguments. Then in
      the end, the result printed by a code block simply consists of the output
      of that function.
    - The trick is to process the vars/result-params and the =full=body=
      variable (~let~ form within =org-babel-execute:template= function) and
      send the appropriate lines to some inferior process (or as an argument to
      some shell command). The inferior process can be created in the function
      =org-babel-template-initiate-session=. The result returned by the inferior
      process (or by the shell command), should be returned by
      =org-babel-execute:template= (of course you might further process it
      before you return it).
    - Don't forget to read the comments in the ob-template file, e.g. for
      sending/receiving output to/from an inferior process, the functions in
      =org-babel-comint= might be useful, etc...

*** google-keyboard-translate-pdf-textregion.el
    Translate text-regions in pdf by keyboard (similar to ~pdf-avy-highlight.el~
    decribed above). Requires https://github.com/atykhonov/google-translate
    
*** pdf-continuous-scroll.el
See [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools/issues/27#issuecomment-696237353][here]]
and the enhanced minor mode version 
[[https://github.com/dalanicolai/pdf-continuous-scroll-mode.el][here]]

*** doc-view-continuous-scroll-djvu.el
   *DOES NOT WORK WELL*. pdf-continuous-scroll.el ported to doc-view-mode.
   However, it worked well until (experimental) functions were added to make it
   sync with djvu.el buffers. So although it could easily made to work with all
   doc-view buffers by removing the djvu specific functions, it currently only
   works with djvu documents.
   
*** doc-view-continuous-scroll.el
    Very quick attempt to revert =doc-view-continuous-scroll-djvu.el= to a
    working state for doc-view.

*** list-factory.el
    Mathematica style 'list comprehensions`. Usage examples are in the
    =erf-deftest= at the end of the file.
    
*** json-to-yasnippet.el
    Very basic vscode json snippet file to yasnippet translator. For usage see
    initial comment within file.
    
*** evil-switch.el
    A simplified equivalent of the [[https://github.com/AndrewRadev/switch.vim][vim-switch plugin]].

** Addtional projects
*** djvu3 [[https://github.com/dalanicolai/djvu3]]
    A newer version of =djvu2= using Emacs its native =svg= rendering
    capabilities.
*** djvu2 https://github.com/dalanicolai/djvu2.el
    Show djvu annotations within Emacs (extending [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/djvu/blob/master/djvu.el][djvu.el]]). There is also a
    [[https://github.com/dalanicolai/djvu-layer][Spacemacs djvu layer]] which additionally [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2020-08/msg01014.html][implements smooth scrolling]] and
    convenient navigation using imenu.
*** toc-mode [[https://github.com/dalanicolai/toc-mode]]
    A package to create and attach Table of contents to pdf and djvu documents.
    There is also a [[https://github.com/dalanicolai/toc-layer][toc-layer for Spacemacs]]
*** sketch-mode [[https://github.com/dalanicolai/sketch-mode]]
    A package for creating quick svg sketches.
